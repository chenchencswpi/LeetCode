You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your 
friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates 
how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") 
and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend 
will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

For example:

Secret number:  "1807"
Friend's guess: "7810"
Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)
Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the 
bulls and B to indicate the cows. In the above example, your function should return "1A3B".

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits, for example:

Secret number:  "1123"
Friend's guess: "0111"
In this case, the 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow, and your function should return "1A1B".
You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.

公牛母牛游戏。你写了个数字让朋友猜。每次他做出一次猜测，你需要给你的朋友一个提示，告诉他猜对了几个（位置和数字全部吻合），猜错了几个（数字
符合，但是位置不合）。猜对的叫公牛，猜错的叫母牛。现在给一个secret数字，也就是朋友要猜的，再给一个guess数字，让你返回有几个公牛，几个母牛。

这道题可以用哈希表来做。首先我们遍历两个字符串，找出公牛数，并且将secret数字中，与guess数字相应位置不符合的字符以及其个数存起来。然后我们
再遍历两个字符串来找出母牛数。其实这道题也不需要哈希表，因为我们知道每个字符肯定是‘0’到‘9’的10个字符中的一个，所以设定一个长度为10的数组就好。
