Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Examples:
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
Notes:
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

给定一个模式和一个字符串，判断字符串是不是符合这个模式。

我们可以用哈希表来存储模式中的字符以及其对应的字符串。代码如下：
