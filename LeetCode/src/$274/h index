Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of 
his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more 
than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers 
in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the 
researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more 
than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

题目的大意是给我们一个研究员的发表的文章的引用数的数组，让我们写一个方法来返回这个研究员的h-index. 根据维基百科
的解释，“一个科学家如果有h-index，那么他有h篇发表的文章的引用量是至少h的，剩下的N-h篇的引用量是小于h的”.如果
这个科学家可能有多个h-index，那么返回最大的。

对数组进行反向排序然后开始遍历。当我们碰到的第一个大于等于引用量的下标，就是我们要找的h-index。
